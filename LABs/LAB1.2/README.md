# LAB 1.2
OpenCL version of the contrast HW function

The goal is to illustrate that using OpenCL the same simple function is much easier to implement. 
We don't need to simulate at the waveform level and the circuit automatically becomes a coprocessor.
All the aditional infrastructure is automatically created for us.
